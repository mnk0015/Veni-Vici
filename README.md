## Notes

While building the app, one of the main challenges I encountered was working with the Cat API and fetching the required information. Initially, the API documentation provided information on fetching cat images, but it lacked details on retrieving specific attributes such as breed, origin, and life span. This required additional investigation and experimentation to understand how to access this data from the API. Additionally, handling errors and ensuring proper error handling when making requests to the API was crucial to providing a smooth user experience. Furthermore, incorporating the ban functionality posed its own set of challenges, particularly in dynamically updating the UI to reflect the banned attributes and allowing users to unban them. Overall, while building the app, navigating the intricacies of backend development, understanding API responses, and effectively fetching and managing data were key challenges that required careful attention and problem-solving.
